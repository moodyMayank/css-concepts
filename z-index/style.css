/* Z-Index 
- specifies the stack order of an element.
- An element with greater stack order is always in front of the element with a lower stack.

Note : z-index only works on elements having position property and flex items 
Note : If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element
positioned last in the HTML code comes on top.
